% Define a predicate hanoi/3 for solving Towers of Hanoi.
hanoi(1, Start, Target, _) :-
    write('Move disk 1 from '), write(Start), write(' to '), writeln(Target).

hanoi(N, Start, Target, Auxiliary) :-
    N > 1,
    M is N - 1,
    hanoi(M, Start, Auxiliary, Target),
    write('Move disk '), write(N),
    write(' from '), write(Start),
    write(' to '), writeln(Target),
    hanoi(M, Auxiliary, Target, Start).

% Example usage:
% To solve Towers of Hanoi with 3 disks from rod 'A' to rod 'C', use: hanoi(3, 'A', 'C', 'B').
